## A poem

They speed around in droves, driving and striving for the troves they don't have.  
What is it that they really need?  
Is it some ineffable inner peace?  
Is it the iPhone 5G, now available at Verizon for $60/mo with a 2 year activation?  

Is there innate value in all life?  
Do all animate beings house an untarnishable soul, or some otherwise immaterial but unquestionable spark?  
Or is life a pretty pattern, puzzling it's own perplexing position in a procedural matrix of data?  

These are the questions not often asked.  
To do so might derail the train we've subconsciously built.  
The train set on tracks laid by dutious, driven by the ambitious, and occupied by the rest of us just trying to get to our unknowable destination in one piece.
