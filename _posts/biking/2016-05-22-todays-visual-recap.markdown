## Recap

Hi again! I'm feeling lazy, and today was a short and relatively quick ride anyways, so let's just do a visual recap! I packed my things up and left my motel, then:

*Rode alongside Lake Erie, keeping it on my right to keep my southwesterly course. No navigation needed today; my route was just one straight shot.*

*Ate pizza and wings at a memorial park in Dunkirk. Noticing an uptick in other bikers in this area now, and saw another guy looking like he was headed cross country. Second time I've seen another person copying me. Nah, I think it's actually becoming a popular thing to do lately.*

*Saw a thing*

*Passed Lake Erie State Park, where camping is offered. My campground was 9 miles down the road however.*

*Arrived at my campground, the first "KOA", Kampgrounds of America, I've ever stayed at. It's really nice, and my probative site (there was also RV spaces) is across a little brook, which an employee crossed in an ATV to show me to. I wisely *walked* my bike across the bridge.*

*Set up camp and put my washed clothes out to dry.*

Also today I took care of some tweaking/maintenance tasks with my bike, one of which was preventing me from riding using the highest back gear and required replacing a bolt on my rack. I solved that one with a stop at a hardware store. It is very rewarding to fix these kinds of problems for ones self, especially when your means of transportation depend on it. Anyways, I plan on spending tomorrow in Pennsylvania and the next day be in Ohio, so we'll see what's going on over in those states. Just note I may find myself too busy exploring Erie and Cleveland to give very thorough updates.

Cya!
