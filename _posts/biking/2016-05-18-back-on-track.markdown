## Catching Up

Hi again! Here's an update for the last two days. I made my way out of Utica and to East Syracuse the first day. I was very happy that everything on my bike appears to be back in 100% working order after my pit stop, but it has yet to regain my full trust. Several hundred more miles should do that.

And then today, I traveled through Syracuse and to Junius, where I'm staying at a campground (which is more of an RV park, but in any case, here I am).

## Utica to Syracuse

I traveled through Utica, which i had gotten a good feel for during my bus rides the day prior while getting my bike repaired. Soon after I was on the Philip Rayhill Memorial Trail. I'm sad to say I don't know who that is. But his trail was very nice, so he must have been a good man. Is that how that works?

*First snack break of the day on the trail, featuring a watershed.*

Then it was back on country roads much like the ones I was on just after entering New York, only even more farmland and a bit less residential.

*This is the kind of view I'm used to having on both sides.*

Near the end of the day I stopped to eat a bunch of chicken wings and pizza, then rolled through Cicero Swamp, where a deer jumped out onto the road about 30 get in from of me, to get spoiled and bounce back into the woods. The road also featured a bunch of smooshed frogs :'( Frogger IRL...

*Cicero Swamp. I would have stopped to take more pictures, but the shoulder was very narrow, and as nice as it was, I decided I didn't want to tip over into it.*

Soon enough I made it to America's Best Value Inn in East Syracuse (it may actually have been the best value, as due to a failure of their credit card system, I'm not entirely sure I paid, even though I pointed it out to them... I'll check later.)

## To the "Campground"

Leaving Syracuse was sort of painful, as it was probably around rush hour and Syracuse isn't really all that nice from an infrastructure standpoint from what I can tell. Regardless, I was happy to pass both a cheap grocery store and a shipping center to send some things home, replacing my bulky camera with the equivalent weight in 100% more edible cargo. Then I was out of Syracuse, and back on the one lane highways with wide shoulders. Legs are starting to get pretty sore at this point, as is my *ahem* saddle. I see another rest day not far in my future.

*I found the windows XP desktop background image.*

I am still ignoring much of the suggested directions coming from my cyber companion, Google Maps, as it is *adamant* on routing me towards the Erie Canal trail, which I know to avoid by now for fear of its stoney dusty wrath. No matter, I charted my own way using roads I've already identified as being as close to bike friendly as possible. The last miles I was admittedly constantly checking my miles, counting down the last couple. It's a habit I'm trying to avoid; getting antsy during the last stretch and pushing it too hard.

I bought a large sub and some snacks at what I learned upon entering was an Amish Owned grocery store, and my bill came out to $6.66. Heh. Then I was at my destination, Junius Ponds Cabins and Campgrounds. It's an odd place. But very niceley maintained. Shame it's not the "real" camping I was looking for, which I imagine I'll get soon enough.

Well that's it for now. Another family owned campground tomorrow, and then to Orchard Park the next day, where I meet up with the routes offered by my paper maps! Cya.
