## People

Hi again! Feeling pretty tired, but I owe it to the people I've met the past two days to give an update! Probably less comments on the landscape in this one, as in some cases it was more of what we've already seen.

I took a short day on Thursday and only went to Attica and got a room at The Attica Motel. It's a nice place on a hill overlooking a little town center. Checking in, I met one of the owners of the property, a very kind woman named Kavita, who gave me some food for my journey in the form of noodles, granola bars, and oatmeal! I am still learning accept such forthcoming kindness and generosity gracefully. We talked about my trip and some other things. I then had time while in my room to plan the next few days, which I am happy to say are looking pretty solid.

*My room in Attica. I personally love the retro vibes I got. Feels nostalgic.*

After a trip to restock on some food I relaxed for a bit. I heard some folks hanging outside and tentatively stood around my door to see who they were. One of them kindly invited me over for a beer and to hang out. Turns out that they were some guys around my age and some older who work on wind power technologies, including work involving scaling the turbines to install new features and service them in various ways. They too were interested in my trip, and we talked about the various things I'll be in for, the good and the hard. It made me excited for the future, and I hope that they can live vicariously through my trip if they keep track of my progress here. They also each has their own adventure stories, which were awesome to hear.

I was even given a huge helping of some food they were grilling, and ate more than enough delicious grilled chicken to make up for my difficulty finding enough protein the past few days. So much kindness when you're traveling alone through new places! I hope to stay in touch with them.

The next day it was off to the Erie Lake shore region. After an initial uphill, the rest of the ride was filled with downhills, so I ate up the miles. I crossed a lot of rivers and creeks as I was approaching the lakes region. Maybe they're inlets? I'm not sure.

*Interesting retro buildings as I was leaning Attica.*

## A Big Lake


Soon enough I caught my first view of Lake Erie, which is like a baby ocean. Hm, cool. Though I am more of a lake based person. Asking the Erie Lake suburbs and towns I saw some really nice houses, some less than nice areas, a few Tim Horton's (which I'm making a mental note to give a try, because why not), and ride in the smoothest road I've been on since I don't remember when. It was that smooth and fast, that I need to explicitly call it out. Before I knew it I was at my destination, which is my last motel for the next week or so before I go on a camping spree and potentially try out an American Hostel experience in Cleveland.

*Lake Erie! It was an overcast day, but I'm interested to see it with less cloud cover.*

I can't wait! Cya next time.
