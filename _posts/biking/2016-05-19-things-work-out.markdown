## Oh

Hiya.

I woke up this morning and got my campsite all packed up. Started rolling my bike off the lot, to find that another of my back wheel's spokes was broken. I knew that it was going to be a long day. I calmed down a bit, threw the fiberfix on my wheel, trued it as well as I could, and took off towards the nearest bike shop, which as sheer luck or blessing or something would have it, was only 6 miles away in Geneva: Geneva Bicycle Center.

Let me be clear: this is the best bike shop I've ever been to. Two floors and an insanely helpful staff, even towards a likely smelly and nerve-shot touring bicyclist in the form of me, this morning. I walked out a chunk of changes lighter, but with my back wheel in a cinder pile somewhere in bike-hell (I like to imagine), replaced with what I am told is a very sturdy mountain bike grade wheel more suited to the task of carrying me and my gear. While there I also decided to buy "clipless" shoes and pedals, which I hope will alleviate some strain on my knees and help me convert more of my energy into useful forward motion. While there I was even given a spare piece to one of my two pumps which had become unusable due to said piece falling off. Like I said, this store was awesome!

## Speed Run

After the pit stop, while I was feeling very happy with the outcome, and as nice as Geneva is, I didn't have much time to cruise around casually, as it was already after noon and I had a full days trip ahead of me, made longer by the detour, as well as more hilly, since the detour took me south, closer to the finger lakes region which has countless ridges running vertically north and south. I guess the terrain could best be described as "wrinkled", viewed at a large scale that is.

*The real star of the day was the weather. Amazing clouds, with a few turning to rain, sometimes near me, sometimes far enough to see the blur of rain.*

*Some cows on one of the many hills were really interested in me, and came to cheer me on. I couldn't help but laugh.*

I found myself battling the clock, even though I arguably didn't need to be. I was headed to another RV park/campground, and hate to be an inconvenience for the person at the office, who in most cases is the owner, who is also living there, and likely has better things to do than wait for a lone guest to haul in late and pay for just a single day. In any case, I had a brisk ride with some nice views, crossing the Genesee River and passing through Caledonia in the final stretches.

I rolled in exhausted at my destination a little after 6pm, which is when I informed the staff I would be there via phone, since I got worried they might close up. I checked in and was guided to my site via golf cart by the owner, then met some part-time residents of the park, who were exceedingly friendly, helpful, and interested in my trip. I was lent a hammer to use for my tent stakes, a ginger ale to suppliment my dinner, and some advice on roads to use. The campsite itself was also very nice, and I showered and used the laundry machines before taking a walk around as the sun set.

*My site. There was also a more grassy tent specific area, but I had requested water and electric. In retrospect, I didn't need them, but I was happy with my neighbors, so it worked out.*

*One of the neighborhoods, for lack a better word.*

So, today started rocky but turned out great! And since my legs are shot, I took the one day trip to Orchard Park and slot it into the next two days. I'm done with 60+ mile days, and am happy to have some 30 mile days in front of me.

And now I sleep.
