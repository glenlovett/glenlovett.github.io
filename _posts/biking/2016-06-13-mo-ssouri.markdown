excerpt: This State is absurd, and I say that endearingly
---

During the past few days Missouri and I have been doing battle. The state has been employing it's collection of comically hilly roadways and army of biker-hungry dogs, and I have been fighting back with my newly beefed up legs.

Three days ago my destination was Meramec State Park, and from what I remember the defining part of the ride was my knowledge that I had a large downhill at the end that brought me into the park. What I didn't know was that the park camping area itself was then a few miles down the road in the park in the other side of a large steep hill, so that was a nice little cherry on the end of my ride. It was one of those "get off your bike and push it up" steep hills, actually the first I've encountered.

Camping that night was defined by sticky humidity, then raccoon mania, as I woke up to my camping neighbors fending off emboldened nocturnal animals in search of scraps. My food was in my airtight panniers so they didn't bother me. I moved the bags out of and away from my tent just to be sure though.

Then next morning after just my first few miles, I was drenched in sweat, since I had to climb the two hills out of the Park, then the Meramec Valley. My destination was a Warm Showers host in Rolla MO.

When I arrived in Rolla early I was so happy to come to learn that my host is a like-minded student studying at Missouri University of Science and Technology, as we're his friendly roommates. That night I had a lot of fun, joining them in a trip to a nearby winery for my first tasting, and then to a cool brewery dining and outdoor dining/lounging area with live music and games including a giant chess board, where played a game of team chess. Lots of fun!

Then yesterday I had a remarkably smooth ride to my next campsite, where I payed just $8 to stay.

Then today. I hesitantly started down a dirt road near the campsite because Google told me to. Turned around after a few miles because nope. Climbed out of the valley the campsite was in. Was dismayed to learn that part of the roads ahead was closed 3 miles away (maybe a bridge out?) so I would have to do a big loop to go around it, adding about 8 miles to the day. So I was already way behind and this was planned be a hilly 55 mile day. Well, I'm finding the easiest cure for any bad mental state that might threaten to invade is just to throw myself at hills repeatedly, so that's what I did until I was about 15 miles from there RV park I'm staying in.

Then I realized my wallet was missing, cued off by fraud alerts on my credit card. Turns out that at least one person in Missouri, when presented with the option of returning a lost wallet or using it to try and make illegal purchases, makes a b-line to McDonalds and gets themselves (and hopefully some other people) a $50 meal. Then to Walmart to try and buy who knows what. I found myself laughing hysterically at that later after the mess was resolved.

How was it resolved? I got money wired to me by my amazing mother, who helped me sort everything out, with a crucial supporting role by my roommates who helped me obtain a source of identification.

The last few miles were some of the most stunningly beautiful of the trip so far. With it being 6:30, the terrain just lit up in saturated colors and made things glow.

My place tonight is very nice and has everything I need! I'll be taking a rest day tomorrow to sort out a few more wallet related things, and then I'll be on my way again!
