excerpt: wherein I jinx the crap out of myself

Posting in the late afternoon? What is this? Am I not out less back on track and caught up with the backlog of things I had to fix?

I hope so.

Yesterday, after my rack was fixed in Pittsfield, I had a choice of making it a 30 mile day or a 65 mile day, given where the opportunities to stay the night were. Since it was already 1pm I didn't think I'd make it the 65, but with a tailwind and mostly flat Kansas ground I cruised through the day to finish in Pittsfield around 5pm. Nice!

I camped there in the city park, which has water, a shower, and electricity. I met a man who was down on his luck and living out of his car, and I used my instincts judge the situation and quickly determined he was an honest and kind guy who just made some mistakes, one of which was mistakenly thinking he would be inheriting a small fortune and retiring early, but it ended up in someone else's hands. That was unfortunate. I wished him the best and he did me.

Then after grabbing food and showering, a fellow biker staying at the motel across the street value came by to say hello. Turns out he's headed the same way me on the trans am, and is loosely traveling with other bikers that have met asking the way. Nice!

We determined we'd likely be headed to the same spot the next day, so i said I'd see him later. He told me what time they get on the road and I knew they'd beat me to it. I'm still being lazy and lounging a bit in the morning.

Anyways, today was my first smooth say with no hiccups or anything, and it felt great! Made it to Eureka KS by 2pm, and meet the travelers there, at the city park by the pool under a shaded picnic area.

There is the man I met the night prior, a couple in a recumbent bike, and a young woman traveling solo as well. It's fun to be part of their crew for the night, and we'll see how long the fellowship lasts! Of course, I have no assumptions that we'll stick together, but it would be nice to have company for a bit. We're currently scheduled to part ways in Pueblo Colorado, where I go West and they stay on the trans-am heading a more winding way northwest.

Until next time!
