## An Update

New format to my posts, starting from now I'll just do short blurbs.

I biked through Springfield today. Started on windy section of 66, then through the city, and onto the interurban bike trail. The latter two parts sheltered me from any wind. I ate Thai in Springfield.

I'm staying the night at Double J Cameron's which is very nice. Here, I met a group of bikers traveling route 66 north, they started in California 6 about 6 weeks ago and are heading Chicago, planning on being there in a few days.

They shared their group dinner with me, which was amazing and very generous. Thanks all!

Ok, that's about enough :)
