Getting close to the coast!

I know I havnt posted in forever, bit I've just been enjoying myself too much, and honestly wireless data is a bit hard to come by when you're camping so often.

I've split off from the group I was with and am now traveling with Alexis and Travis, from Oakland CA. They flew to NYC and are cycling home. They're really fun to travel with!

Today's ride was about 64 miles, from Mt. Vernon Oregon to Mitchell Oregon. We had one pass to go over at the end of the day but it was nice and gradual for 20 miles leading up to it, so not too steep.

We're staying in this AMAZING bike hostel called Spoke'n in Mitchell, which just opened up this year and the owners are working hard at making even more amazing. It's like a Disney movie out something, seriously. I don't deserve it.

Staying here tonight, and another amazing bike hostel called the Bike Inn last night (Oregon is amazingly friendly to bike touring) has got me super spoiled, but I'm looking at a few campgrounds in the next few days, and my last two serious climbs before descending to sea level!

If things go according to plan be at the ocean in four or so days! Florence Oregon specifically.

Until next time.
