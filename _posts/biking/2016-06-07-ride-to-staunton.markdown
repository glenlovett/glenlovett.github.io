Rode to Staunton. Hopefully my last motel for a while.

Chilled with the bunnies in the morning. Had a bumpy ride on some rough road sections, so my butt hurts.

Saw some pieces of Americana on the road, including a giant rocking chair.

Not much else to say! Short day towards St. Louis tomorrow, including maybe some exploring.
