## The first test

I knew going into today that the next two days would be physically challenging. Today due to the steep climbs and tomorrow due to a long ride. In fact, the hills today are some of the largest I'll encounter into further towards the west coast. So I'm glad to say I got through them ok!

My ride started finishing the last of the Rail Trail out of Hadley. I crossed the Connecticut River, making good progress but knowing to pace myself. But I didn't want to go too slowly, as I knew that rain was moving in from the West.

Soon enough I was starting to climb. I began seeing some brooks and streams following under and adjacent to the roads, and the wooded hills in front of me were now on either side of me. There were two hills to climb, and this was the smaller of the two. I made sure to fuel up periodically and drink water at frequent intervals. The reward for the work was seeing some majestic scenery.

*Majestic*

Before noon I had reached the top of the first hill, and bought some water at a general store. The more I ride, the more I see and appreciate the numerous small rustic general stores supplying the little towns I pass through. Each has their own character.

*Route 9 was paralleled with shallow but quick moving rivers.*

With that done, I had a downhill to prep me for the second climb, which I was soon working on. This one required a few breaks, but I eventually crested the top after passing signs welcoming me to the Berkshires, making my way into Windsor MA, where I saw another touring bike paper outside another general store.

Afterwards was the longest downhill I ever had the pleasure of riding. There was some really nice scenery on the way, but I didn't stop to take pictures, opting instead just to cruise.

Soon I was entering Pittsfield MA, which I can only describe as a mini Worcester. Their primary export seems to be auto parts, given the businesses passed. I rode straight to my motel and ducked inside, just moments after it started to downpour.

Time to rest up for the less hilly, but long ride tomorrow!
