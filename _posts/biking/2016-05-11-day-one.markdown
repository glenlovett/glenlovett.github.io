## One Last Morning In Somerville

Hi again! My trip has finally started. I said goodbye to my loved ones over the last few days and weeks, bid my roommates goodbye, and slept in one last time. Two days prior to today I took a trip to a beach near Boston and did a ceremonial placing of my back tire in the Atlantic, which is as corny as it sounds. But with that done and everything packed, I felt ready. Today I biked a bit over 45 miles to West Boylston, just north of Worcester. I started the trip by turning onto the Minuteman Commuter Bike Path, which starts just outside my apartment conveniently enough.

After riding it's length, as well as the extension which takes the form of a dirt path, I passed through Concord. While riding the dirt section through beautiful wooded areas on a nice day, I got a brief euphoria about what lies ahead, thinking about the freedom I'll have. I saw a cool swamp with small small birds (maybe finches?) and a water snake.

*I had passed this swampy area just off the path before, but never saw it or stopped.*

Having passed through Lexington and Concord, I continued West at a decent clip on public roads through small towns and past farmlands and farm stands. I stopped along the way to grab an Ice Cream and take a break. Then it was full steam ahead to the Wachusett valley area. I battled and conquered a decent sized climb to come to the top of a vineyard with a scenic view of the surrounding central MA landscape, then descended back down to about the elevation I started at.

One last push last ahead, and I passed by Wachusett Reservoir a few times on the well maintained roads I took. These are my favorite kinds of roads; in between tall pine trees where the wind is kept down, three smell of the trees is noticeable, and there is occasionally even some shade.

*Flat and calm*

A few miles more and I made it to my destination, a motel with a 70s vibe (the defunct front office is very triangular and has glass walls). I grabbed some pasta and a frozen beef stir fry meal from Walmart as a sort of preview of thing's likely to come in my future, made it in the small kitchen of my room, and am now sitting down to watch some TV and relax. Tomorrow brings a longer ride , so I'll say goodbye until then, and try to rest up!
