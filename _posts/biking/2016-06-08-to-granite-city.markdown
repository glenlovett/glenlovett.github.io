excerpt: Short ride, lots of food.
---

I rode to Granite City IL, just east of St Louis and the Mississippi River, and only 35 miles or so from my motel this morning.

Most of the ride was on a bike path, so it was very pleasant. Following paper maps mostly now. Only rough part was a road under construction. I got off and walked.

When I got to my campsite early I rode into town to get food. So far today I've eaten:

* Banana
* Small cup yogurt
* Waffle with butter and syrup 
* Serving of Quaker oatmeal
* Cinnamon roll
* Toast
* Brisket sandwich
* Another serving of brisket (burnt ends)
* Serving of beans
* Two servings of Mac and cheese
* Couple glasses orange juice
* Can of sprite

All by around 2pm. I'm basically trying to bulk up my legs for the hills in Missouri. Took a quick swim and I'm resting by the pool now.

BBQ down here is much easier to get than in Boston, unsurprisingly.

As you can tell, I'm really roughing it.
